# Prompt Engineering

*Techniques and best practices for effective LLM interaction*

## Core Principles

### Clarity and Specificity
- **Be explicit:** Clearly state what you want
- **Provide context:** Give relevant background information
- **Specify format:** Define expected output structure
- **Set constraints:** Limit response scope and length

### Role Definition
```text
You are an expert data scientist with 10 years of experience in machine learning.
Your task is to explain complex ML concepts in simple terms for a business audience.
```

### Context Management
- **Relevant information:** Include necessary background
- **Avoid redundancy:** Don't repeat obvious information
- **Progressive disclosure:** Build context gradually

## Prompt Patterns

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
```text
Let's approach this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the problem...
2. Next, let's identify the key components...
3. Finally, let's solve it...

Problem: Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5.
```

### Few-Shot Learning
```text
Example 1:
Input: "What is 2+2?"
Output: "2+2 equals 4."

Example 2:
Input: "What is 5+3?"
Output: "5+3 equals 8."

Now, what is 7+4?
```

### Zero-Shot Learning
```text
Given a text, classify it as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Text: "I love this product! It's amazing."
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Temperature Control
- **Low temperature (0-0.3):** Deterministic, focused responses
- **Medium temperature (0.3-0.7):** Balanced creativity and consistency
- **High temperature (0.7-1.0):** Creative, diverse responses

### System vs User Messages
```text
System: You are a helpful coding assistant. Always provide code examples in Python.

User: How do I create a function that calculates the factorial of a number?
```

### Function Calling
```json
{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get current weather for a location",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "City name"
      }
    },
    "required": ["location"]
  }
}
```

## Domain-Specific Prompts

### Code Generation
```text
Write a Python function that:
- Takes a list of numbers as input
- Returns the sum of all even numbers
- Includes error handling for invalid inputs
- Has clear documentation
```

### Data Analysis
```text
Analyze this dataset and provide:
1. Summary statistics
2. Key insights
3. Potential issues or anomalies
4. Recommendations for further analysis

Dataset: [data here]
```

### Content Creation
```text
Create a blog post about machine learning that:
- Targets beginners
- Uses simple language
- Includes practical examples
- Is 500-800 words
- Has a clear structure with headings
```

## Evaluation and Testing

### Prompt Testing Framework
1. **Define success criteria:** What constitutes a good response?
2. **Create test cases:** Diverse scenarios and edge cases
3. **Measure performance:** Accuracy, relevance, completeness
4. **Iterate and improve:** Refine based on results

### A/B Testing
```text
Version A: "Explain machine learning"
Version B: "Explain machine learning in simple terms for a business audience"

Compare responses for clarity, relevance, and usefulness.
```

### Human Evaluation
- **Relevance:** Does the response address the query?
- **Accuracy:** Is the information correct?
- **Completeness:** Does it cover all aspects?
- **Clarity:** Is it easy to understand?

## Common Pitfalls

### What to Avoid
- **Vague prompts:** Unclear or ambiguous instructions
- **Overly complex:** Too many requirements at once
- **Missing context:** Insufficient background information
- **Inconsistent formatting:** Unclear output expectations

### Better Approaches
- **Iterative refinement:** Start simple, add complexity
- **Clear structure:** Use numbered lists and bullet points
- **Specific examples:** Provide concrete instances
- **Feedback loops:** Test and improve continuously

## Tools and Frameworks

### Prompt Management
- **LangChain:** Prompt templates and chains
- **Promptfoo:** Prompt testing and evaluation
- **Weights & Biases:** Experiment tracking

### Evaluation Metrics
- **BLEU Score:** Text similarity
- **ROUGE Score:** Text summarization quality
- **Custom metrics:** Domain-specific evaluation

### Version Control
```yaml
# prompt.yaml
version: "1.0"
description: "Code generation prompt"
template: |
  You are an expert Python developer.
  Write clean, well-documented code for: {{task}}
  
  Requirements:
  - Follow PEP 8 style guide
  - Include type hints
  - Add comprehensive docstrings
  - Handle edge cases
```

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- **Prompt templates:** Reusable components
- **Version history:** Track changes and improvements
- **Usage guidelines:** Clear instructions for team members

### Security Considerations
- **Input validation:** Sanitize user inputs
- **Output filtering:** Validate LLM responses
- **Rate limiting:** Prevent abuse
- **Content policies:** Ensure appropriate responses

### Performance Optimization
- **Token efficiency:** Minimize unnecessary tokens
- **Caching:** Store common responses
- **Batching:** Process multiple requests together

## Real-World Applications

### Customer Support
```text
You are a customer support agent for a tech company.
A customer is experiencing issues with our product.
Provide helpful, empathetic assistance while gathering necessary information.
```

### Content Moderation
```text
Review this content for:
- Inappropriate language
- Hate speech
- Misinformation
- Copyright violations

Content: [text to review]
```

### Code Review
```text
Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code quality
- Best practices

Code: [code block]
```

> **Key Principle:** Effective prompt engineering is iterative and context-dependent. Start with clear, specific prompts and refine based on results and feedback.
