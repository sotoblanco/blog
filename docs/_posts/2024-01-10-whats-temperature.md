# What's Temperature in AI Models?

If you've worked with language models like GPT, Claude, or other generative AI systems, you've likely encountered the "temperature" parameter. But what exactly does temperature do, and how should you use it?

## Understanding Temperature

Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of predictions in neural networks, particularly in language models. It's named after the concept of temperature in statistical mechanics.

### How Temperature Works

When a language model generates text, it produces a probability distribution over all possible next tokens (words or characters). Temperature modifies this distribution:

- **Low temperature (0.1-0.3)**: Makes the model more conservative, favoring high-probability tokens
- **High temperature (0.8-1.5)**: Makes the model more creative and random, giving lower-probability tokens a better chance

## Mathematical Foundation

The temperature parameter is applied during the softmax operation:

```
P(token_i) = exp(logit_i / T) / Σ(exp(logit_j / T))
```

Where:
- `T` is the temperature
- `logit_i` is the raw output score for token i
- `P(token_i)` is the final probability

## Practical Applications

### Temperature = 0.0 (Deterministic)
- Always selects the most likely token
- Produces consistent, predictable outputs
- Best for: Factual Q&A, code generation, translations

### Temperature = 0.3-0.5 (Low)
- Slightly more varied but still coherent
- Good balance of creativity and accuracy
- Best for: Professional writing, summarization

### Temperature = 0.7-1.0 (Medium)
- More creative and diverse outputs
- May occasionally produce unexpected results
- Best for: Creative writing, brainstorming

### Temperature = 1.2+ (High)
- Very creative but potentially incoherent
- High variability in outputs
- Best for: Experimental creative tasks

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start with standard values** (0.7-0.8 for creative tasks, 0.1-0.3 for factual tasks)
2. **Adjust based on your needs**: Lower for consistency, higher for creativity
3. **Test systematically**: Try different values with the same prompt to see the effect
4. **Consider your audience**: Professional outputs typically need lower temperature

## Common Misconceptions

- **Higher temperature ≠ Better creativity**: Extremely high values often produce nonsense
- **Temperature ≠ Intelligence**: It only affects randomness, not the model's capabilities
- **One size fits all**: Different tasks require different temperature settings

## Conclusion

Temperature is a powerful tool for controlling AI model behavior. Understanding how to use it effectively can significantly improve your results, whether you're building applications or just trying to get better outputs from AI systems.

The key is experimentation—find the temperature settings that work best for your specific use cases and adjust accordingly.
