# Machine Learning Fundamentals

This note covers the essential concepts that form the foundation of machine learning.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning with labeled examples
- **Goal**: Predict outputs for new inputs
- **Examples**: Classification, Regression
- **Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Finding patterns in data without labels
- **Goal**: Discover hidden structure
- **Examples**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- **Algorithms**: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN, Autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction and rewards
- **Goal**: Maximize cumulative reward
- **Examples**: Game playing, Robot control
- **Algorithms**: Q-Learning, Policy Gradients, Actor-Critic

## Key Concepts

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- **Bias**: Error from overly simplistic assumptions
- **Variance**: Error from sensitivity to small fluctuations
- **Goal**: Balance both for optimal performance

### Overfitting vs Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data, poor generalization
- **Underfitting**: Model too simple, fails to capture patterns
- **Solution**: Regularization, cross-validation, proper model complexity

### Cross-Validation
- Split data into multiple folds
- Train on some folds, validate on others
- Provides better estimate of model performance
- Common types: k-fold, stratified, time series

## Model Evaluation Metrics

### Classification
- **Accuracy**: Correct predictions / Total predictions
- **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Regression
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **RÂ²**: Coefficient of determination

## Feature Engineering

### Feature Selection
- Remove irrelevant or redundant features
- Methods: Filter, Wrapper, Embedded
- Goal: Improve performance and reduce complexity

### Feature Scaling
- **Normalization**: Scale to [0,1] range
- **Standardization**: Zero mean, unit variance
- **Robust Scaling**: Use median and IQR

### Feature Creation
- Polynomial features
- Interaction terms
- Domain-specific transformations
- Text: TF-IDF, embeddings
- Time series: Lag features, rolling statistics

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic models before complex ones
2. **Understand your data**: EDA is crucial
3. **Validate properly**: Use appropriate CV strategies
4. **Avoid data leakage**: Future information shouldn't inform past predictions
5. **Monitor performance**: Track metrics over time
6. **Document everything**: Reproducibility is key

## Common Pitfalls

- Using accuracy for imbalanced datasets
- Not scaling features for distance-based algorithms
- Tuning hyperparameters on test set
- Ignoring data distribution shifts
- Over-engineering features

## Resources for Learning

- **Books**: "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop
- **Courses**: Andrew Ng's ML Course, Fast.ai
- **Practice**: Kaggle competitions
- **Papers**: Read foundational papers in your area of interest

Remember: Machine learning is both an art and a science. Theory provides the foundation, but practical experience builds intuition.
