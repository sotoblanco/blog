# Deep Learning Tips & Tricks

A collection of practical tips for training neural networks effectively, gathered from experience and research.

## Data Preparation

### Data Augmentation
- **Images**: Rotation, flipping, cropping, color jittering
- **Text**: Synonym replacement, back-translation
- **Audio**: Time stretching, pitch shifting, noise addition
- **Best Practice**: Apply augmentation during training, not validation

### Normalization
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalize inputs to each layer
- **Layer Normalization**: Alternative for RNNs and Transformers
- **Input Normalization**: Scale inputs to [0,1] or standardize

## Architecture Design

### Network Depth vs Width
- **Deeper networks**: Better feature hierarchies, harder to train
- **Wider networks**: More parameters per layer, easier optimization
- **ResNet insight**: Skip connections enable very deep networks

### Activation Functions
- **ReLU**: Standard choice, simple and effective
- **Leaky ReLU**: Prevents dying neurons
- **GELU**: Good for Transformers
- **Swish/SiLU**: Self-gated, smooth activation

### Regularization Techniques
- **Dropout**: Randomly zero neurons during training
- **DropConnect**: Randomly zero connections
- **Weight Decay**: L2 penalty on weights
- **Early Stopping**: Stop when validation loss plateaus

## Training Strategies

### Learning Rate
- **Too high**: Loss explodes or oscillates
- **Too low**: Slow convergence, gets stuck in local minima
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Cosine annealing, step decay
- **Warmup**: Gradually increase LR at start

### Optimization
- **Adam**: Good default choice, adaptive learning rates
- **AdamW**: Adam with decoupled weight decay
- **SGD with momentum**: Sometimes better for final performance
- **Gradient clipping**: Prevent exploding gradients

### Batch Size
- **Large batches**: Stable gradients, better hardware utilization
- **Small batches**: More frequent updates, better generalization
- **Batch size scheduling**: Start large, decrease over time

## Debugging Neural Networks

### Loss Curves
- **Training loss decreasing**: Model is learning
- **Validation loss increasing**: Overfitting
- **Both plateau**: Learning rate too low or model capacity limit

### Common Issues
- **Vanishing gradients**: Use residual connections, proper initialization
- **Exploding gradients**: Gradient clipping, lower learning rate
- **Mode collapse** (GANs): Diversity regularization, different architectures

### Sanity Checks
1. Overfit a small dataset (should reach near 0 loss)
2. Check gradient flow (gradients should not be too small/large)
3. Visualize learned features (especially in CNNs)
4. Compare to simple baselines

## Transfer Learning

### When to Use
- **Small dataset**: Always use pre-trained models
- **Large dataset**: Fine-tune or train from scratch
- **Similar domain**: Fine-tune all layers
- **Different domain**: Freeze early layers, train later ones

### Best Practices
- Use lower learning rate for pre-trained layers
- Different learning rates for different layer groups
- Data augmentation becomes more important
- Monitor for negative transfer

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Important Parameters (in order)
1. Learning rate
2. Architecture (depth, width)
3. Batch size
4. Regularization strength
5. Optimization algorithm parameters

### Search Strategies
- **Grid search**: Exhaustive but expensive
- **Random search**: Often more efficient than grid
- **Bayesian optimization**: Smart search using prior results
- **Population-based training**: Evolve hyperparameters during training

## Memory Optimization

### Reducing Memory Usage
- **Gradient checkpointing**: Trade computation for memory
- **Mixed precision**: Use FP16 with FP32 fallback
- **Gradient accumulation**: Simulate large batches
- **Model parallelism**: Split model across devices

### Efficient Training
- **Data loading**: Use multiple workers, prefetch data
- **Compiled models**: TensorRT, TorchScript, XLA
- **Profiling**: Find bottlenecks in your training loop

## Practical Tips

1. **Start simple**: Use proven architectures before inventing new ones
2. **Ablation studies**: Change one thing at a time
3. **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds, document everything
4. **Version control**: Track code, data, and model versions
5. **Monitoring**: Use tools like Weights & Biases, TensorBoard

## Common Mistakes

- Not shuffling data between epochs
- Using training accuracy to make decisions
- Inconsistent preprocessing between train/test
- Not accounting for class imbalance
- Tuning on test set instead of validation set

Remember: Deep learning is empirical. What works for one problem might not work for another. Always validate your approaches experimentally.
